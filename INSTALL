To install this package, you need a C99 compliant compiler, and the LV2 headers
installed on your system.

To install on a Debian-based system (Ubuntu, this means you!), you should should
run 

dpkg-buildpackage

from this directory.  This will build a .deb file in the parent directory.  This
can be installed with 

sudo dpkg -i ../blah.deb

If you're not on a debian based system, just run

make
sudo make install

Or use your system-specific packaging mechanism, if you know how to do that.
