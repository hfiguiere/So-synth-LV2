Description: Set of synthesizers for the LV2 plugin format
 This package is an unofficial port of a set of synthesizers
 written by 50m30n3 to the LV2 plugin format.  In order to use
 it, you need a host for LV2 plugins such as Ardour, Qtractor,
 or Ingen.  This package contains three synthesizers, a feedback
 drone synthesizer, a piano synthesizer, and a bassline synthesizer.
